Firefogg provides an API that allows websites to encode videos before uploading
them to the server; websites provide the encoding settings.
upload is than via HTTP POST. 
To provide resume functionality your server must support chunk based POST
upload as described at http://firefogg.org/dev/chunk_post.html
